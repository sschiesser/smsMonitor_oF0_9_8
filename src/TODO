Resolve resolution issue
In BluetoothHelper::loadDevices check if devices with identifier == null are found. (Do these devices have to be added to the ui list as well?
Decouple objective C code from ofApp and make ofApp a C++ class again
Implement disconnection function
make UI beautiful
resolve error: can't export app and then open it from desktop. (can't load file assertion fails in imgui_draw.cpp line 1196)
Device huge methods in ofApp.cpp up into multiple smaller ones

Separate sensors & remote windows to display independant values:
- link quality
- battery level
(-buttons)
- OSC settings (same by default but changeable)
(- no need for packet reception statistics)
